- Azure Event Hubs -> Provides big data streaming service. Served analytics for consumption
- Power BI streaming API -> Sent to power BI for real time visualisation

Azure HDInsight

- Low cost
- Data Warehousing
- Batch processing
- Hadoop, Spark, Kafka
- HBase -> NoSQL db that is commonly used for search engines

Azure Data Catalog

Azure Databricks

Azure Data Factory

Data Serialisation Languages

- XML
